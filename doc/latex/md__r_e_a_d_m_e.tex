Academic project as part of the {\tt I\+N\+F552 course at Ã‰cole Polytechnique}.

The goal of the project is to apply computer vision tools to the {\tt cityscapes dataset}, which consists in stereo images from cameras mounted on a car.

We start with the left image, disparity and camera matrix.





From the left image, disparity, and the camera matrix, we reconstruct a 3d point cloud of the street.



Using the R\+A\+N\+S\+AC algorithm, we detect the main plane of the 3d point cloud i.\+e. the road.



We then use a modified version of the R\+A\+N\+S\+AC algorithm to detect vertical objects.
